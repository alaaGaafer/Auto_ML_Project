- is there a better way instead CSV nn 
- modify the cash algo (assem) finished
- mofify the smac to get only the loss not the time(callbacks,loss,scenario) (assem)
- add the sarima to cash (assem and alaa)
- use sarima and arima in best model (assem and alaa)
- connect the similarity search to feature extractor(alaa))
- create search on by key knowledge base(alaa)
- connect preprocessing to data (assem)
- get cleaned datasets(alaa)
- test the results(assem)
- connect the smac to cleaned datasets(assem)
- connect smac to similarity search(assem)
- use the combinations between the cleaned datasets with similarity search and get the best model(asseM) (finished
- train the best model with high fidelity(assem)(finished)
- add time series to best models (assem and alaa)
