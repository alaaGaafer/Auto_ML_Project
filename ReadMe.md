# our tasks to track feel free to choose one
- is there a better way instead CSV nn 
- modify the cash algo (assem) finished
- add multifidelity facade to the logreg smac(assem) NN for MVP
- mofify the smac to get only the loss not the time(callbacks,loss,scenario) (assem)
- add the sarima to cash (assem and alaa)
- use sarima and arima in best model (assem and alaa)
- connect the similarity search to feature extractor(alaa))
- create search on by key knowledge base(alaa)
- connect preprocessing to data frontend-backend (assem)
- get cleaned datasets(alaa)
- test the results(assem) (semifinished, test the regresstion and SVM)
- use the combinations between the cleaned datasets with similarity search and get the best model(asseM) (finished)
- train the best model with high fidelity(assem)(finished)
- add time series to best models (assem and alaa)
- complete the database (nada and zeina)
- connect front end with back end to (all team)
